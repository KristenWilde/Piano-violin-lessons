		<p>My studio walls have listened in on group lessons, jam sessions, and cozy recitals. Classes of young children have sung and danced around this bright room. 
		After the sun goes down, I relish moments alone polishing my classical favorites. But most often, my studio 
		welcomes the dedicated private students who pass through the door every week. Together we watch the magic of seeing their abilities grow!

					She allows them to work at their own pace and is able to adapt to their needs.  Mrs. Kristen has a great love of music!  
					Music education benefits children greatly, and we are glad we have Mrs. Kristen to lead our journey."

					and proud when she masters a hard one. I love that Kristen is so patient when she has an off-week, or when 
					there's an occasional song she just won't practice for some reason. Kristen is always positive and understanding,
					while still making sure she keeps moving along."</p>
