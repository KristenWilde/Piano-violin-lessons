		<p style="line-height:200%">Violins and violas can make beautiful sounds, with some skill . . . and I can help!  I have taught violin for over 
			10 years, and am trained in the Suzuki Method (an innovative way of teaching that helps break complex skills down to bite-sized steps). 
			I love teaching adults as well as children as young as age 4.5. Up to age 9 or 10, a parent should plan to 
			participate in lessons and supervise daily practice. Recitals are held 2-3 times per year.

		<h3>FAQ</h3>
		<h4>What is the Suzuki Method?</h4>
		<p>The Suzuki Method is an innovative way of teaching violin playing that has become popular all over the world. Some important features of this method 
		that I apply to my teaching:
		<ul>
			<li>Technique (the physical skills involved in making sound from the violin) is taught in isolation from reading music.  </li>
			<li>For young children, a parent must be involved in lessons and daily practice. </li>
			<li>A repertoire of pieces is learned mainly by ear, from a CD that should be listened to every day.</li>
			<li>This repertoire is memorized and continually reviewed as the student progresses.</li>
		</ul>

		</p>
		
		<h4>What size violin should I rent/buy for my child?</h4>
		<p>Getting the right size violin is very important, so please allow me to measure your child.  I have several small violins that can be used for sizing.
		</p>
		
		<h4>How much practice is expected?</h4>
		<p>Beginning violin involves getting used to a lot of new movements, so I recommend short practice sessions (5-10 minutes), twice a day if possible.  Eventually this can be consolidated to 
			one longer session, but please plan on practicing every day.</p>
